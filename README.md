# HybridAGI Library

This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of `.cypher` files for building and leveraging the power of HybridAGI. These `.cypher` files serve as cognitive program templates that enable you to design and implement sophisticated HybridAGI systems.

## About HybridAGI

HybridAGI represents the fusion of advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) technologies with hybrid architectures that combine the strengths of both machine learning models and explicit programming. This approach aims to bridge the gap between the impressive language generation abilities of large language models and the need for logical reasoning and decision-making capabilities. By integrating advanced machine learning models with explicit programming, HybridAGI systems excel in language generation, logical reasoning, and decision-making tasks.

## Repository Contents

The HybridAGI Library primarily consists of a wide range of `.cypher` files, each representing a unique cognitive program or a component of a larger HybridAGI system. These files are carefully designed to empower your AGI system with the ability to follow logical paths, make decisions, and execute actions using external tools.

## Getting Started

To start utilizing the HybridAGI Library, simply clone or download this repository to your local machine, if you installed HybridAGI successfully, the library should be installed. You can then browse through the different sections and explore the available `.cypher` files. Feel free to modify, combine, and customize these files to suit your specific requirements and objectives. To learn how to program HybridAGI please [follow this tutorial](programs/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to the HybridAGI Library are highly encouraged and appreciated. If you have created novel Cypher files, improved existing programs, or developed utility functions that can benefit the HybridAGI community, we welcome your contributions.

## Support and Feedback

If you need assistance or have questions regarding the HybridAGI Library, feel free to open an issue in the repository. We also appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have to improve the library and make it more valuable for the community.

Let's unlock the true potential of HybridAGI together with the HybridAGI Library. Happy programming and exploring the realms of Artificial General Intelligence!
